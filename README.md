Redact-Ted

Meet Ted. He works for the CIA—but don’t expect him to be chasing spies just yet. Ted’s dream of becoming an agent is on hold… until he conquers the one mission he can’t avoid: the paperwork.

A mountain of secret documents sits on his desk, each one full of sensitive information that must be redacted with precision. Your job is to help Ted highlight, cover, and protect the secrets before the timer runs out. The faster and more accurate you are, the closer Ted gets to achieving his dream of real espionage.

Can you help Ted survive the paperwork and finally become a CIA agent—or will he be buried in redactions forever?
